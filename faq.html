					<h2><a name="mission">Application Process</a></h2>
						<h3>When should I start?</h3>
							<p>
								Many international students start applying the vacation break after they graduate from high school and we recommend you start then too. The college application process can be time consuming therefore applying during this period ensures that you can focus on applications and not have to worry about being distracted from school work. Also applying during this period ensures that the results of your final secondary school examination are available to be included in your application. However, if you are enrolled in a post-secondary programme for example British A levels, International Baccalaureate, an American school or African Leadership Academy, then you should start during the vacation break before you start your final year.
							</p>
						<h3>How do I begin?</h3>
							<p>
								Start by researching institutions in the country you would like to study in. The keys to success in your college applications are persistence and information gathering. Find out what goes in an application and begin thinking about how you are going to collect the materials you need. The educational unit of the consulate/embassy of the country you intend to apply to is a good source of reliable information and a good place to become familiar with.
							</p>
						<h3>Do I need to apply through an Agent?</h3>
							<p>
								You need not. It is best you try to complete all parts of your application on your own. You should be aware of the application process and should not delegate your college application to your friends, family or any other third party. It is alright to receive counsel and advice from various sources and make use of services available to your from different agencies, however your application is expected to contain wholly accurate information and you should treat it as such.
							</p>
						<h3>How should I apply?</h3>
							<p>
								Visit the university/college admissions page for undergraduates, read the requirements carefully and follow the instructions there. Most schools in the United States use Common Application and most schools in the UK use UCAS. For schools that have their own application system, use the particular system the school requires. It is recommended that you fill and submit your applications online. This is to ensure that your application can be properly tracked and documented by the college/university. Many colleges require that you fulfill a standardized testing requirement and a proof of English proficiency requirement so you should make arrangements to take the required tests. Obtain all other required application materials and check to see that you have checked off everything on the school’s application checklist, after which you can submit your application. Make sure to submit your application and materials well before the school’s deadline.
							</p>
						<h3>When should I expect a decision?</h3>
							<p>
								The best answer to this question may be found on the admissions webpage of the college/university you are applying to. For a general timeline: Assuming you are applying for fall admission, acceptance results are usually sent out from late March to mid April for many schools in the US and UK. Schools that have rolling admissions policy or late deadlines may send out admissions decisions later and schools that have early applications (early action, early decision etc.) often send out acceptance results later.
							</p>
					<h2><a name="mission">Researching Institutions</a></h2>
						<h3>What Institutions should I consider?</h3>
							<p>
								Start by making a list of colleges/universities that you know of in the country you intend to apply to. Also you can ask family, friends, teachers to recommend institutions in that country to you. Alternatively, you can do a simple google search or visit the education center of the country in your own country. Visit the website of the schools on your list and learn as much about the school as possible. If the school captures your interest then you should consider applying.
							</p>
						<h3>What factors should I consider?</h3>
							<p>
								Again make a list of what you would like in a college, what your budget is and what limitations you have. Create a checklist for each school that captures your interest based on your list. Some important factors to consider are accreditation, admission requirements, tuition cost, location, school size, availability of your intended major amongst others.
							</p>
						<h3>What do schools mean by “an applicant’s fit”?</h3>
							<p>
								Many schools take a holistic approach to accepting applicants. This means that the decision to admit an applicant is based upon a consideration of all available information about the candidate. This helps the college make the decision to admit an applicant even if there may be a negative component of his application. Colleges with this policy are not simply looking for students with stellar grades. They place emphasis on applicants that can contribute to the college campus in meaningful ways. Thus, applicants who possess the personality, interests and talents to contribute to an institution are a fit to the institution.
							</p>
					<h2><a name="mission">Application Materials</a></h2>
						<h3>What application materials should I submit?</h3>
							<p>
								You should submit all the materials required by the institution you are applying. Regardless of where you’re applying you should collect secondary school transcripts, high school leaving exam results, standardized test results and teachers’ recommendations.
							</p>
						<h3>Should I send additional materials?</h3>
							<p>
								It is best you express everything about your qualifications and qualities in the materials requested. The college application is specifically designed by institutions to make sure they get all the information they need about each applicant. If you feel it’s absolutely necessary to send additional material, email an admissions officer or talk to an education adviser at the consulate.
							</p>
						<h3>Who should I ask for a recommendation?</h3>
							<p>
								You should ask for a recommendation from a teacher that you have interacted with and knows you personally. The recommendation should not just list accolades and achievements that you have gotten but should offer insights into your academic ability, leadership quality and personality traits.
							</p>
						<h3>How important is the application essay/personal statement?</h3>
							<p>
								The application essay(s) or personal statement(s) is a crucial aspect of your application. Depending on the country you’re applying to, the essay could serve a variety of purposes. Most US colleges use the essay for an insight into the personality and life of the applicant. The essay is your chance to shine and show your talents to the admissions officers. For most other schools in many countries, the personal statement or application essay is a chance to coherently express your interest in your chosen field of study.
							</p>
					<h2><a name="mission">Standardized Testing</a></h2>
						<h3>What tests do I have to take?</h3>
							<p>
								If you are applying to an institution in the United States, you will need to take the SAT and perhaps the TOEFL and the SAT subject test (depending on the institution) in addition to your high school leaving examinations. Institutions from other english speaking countries might also require TOEFL as well but not necessarily the SAT.
							</p>
						<h3>Is there an alternative to SAT?</h3>
							<p>
								If you are applying to an institution in the United States, most schools accept the ACT as a substitute to the SAT. The ACT is not offered in every country so make sure you’re able to register for it from your home country.
							</p>
						<h3>Should I take the SAT subject tests?</h3>
							<p>
								If you are applying to an institution in the United States that requires SAT subject test scores for the programme you are interested in, you should register for and take the SAT subject test examinations. However if your institution does not require subject test scores, the choice to take the test is entirely yours
							</p>
						<h3>What is an acceptable SAT score?</h3>
							<p>
								Most schools do not have an acceptable SAT score or a cutoff SAT score. Work hard and prepare adequately for the examination and try to do your best on it. Whilst preparing you may set a target score that falls within the score range for previously accepted students of that school. However getting this score often does not guarantee admission into the school.
							</p>
						<h3>My SAT score is lower than the score or range on the admissions website?</h3>
							<p>
								Do not panic. Most schools publish the average score or the range for the middle 50% of their previous incoming classes. This means that many students who scored below the published score or range were still granted admission into the school. If you believe your score is quite low and not indicative of your academic abilities, you may use the additional information section of the application to explain your circumstances.
							</p>
						<h3>What is TOEFL and why do I need it?</h3>
							<p>
								TOEFL stands for Test Of English as a Foreign Language and is a test of english proficiency for non native english speakers. Most english speaking schools require the TOEFL or a substitute (such as IELTS) from most international students regardless of the official language of the applicant’s country. Check your institution's admissions webpage to find out if the requirement is waived for your country, otherwise you should plan to take the TOEFL and send your scores to all the schools you are applying.
							</p>
					<h2><a name="mission">Student Visa</a></h2>
						<h3>Do I need a Student Visa?</h3>
							<p>
								All students intending to study in a foreign country require a student visa to enable them enter the country to begin their education. The only exceptions are students who a citizens or permanent residents of the country they are travelling to.
							</p>
						<h3>When should I apply for a Student Visa?</h3>
							<p>
								You should begin applying for a student visa after you have been accepted into your institution. Upon acceptance you will receive a document from your institution to help you apply for a student visa or you will receive confirmation from your school that you can begin the visa application process. Do not apply for a visa or buy an airline prior to the release of your admissions result.
							</p>
						<h3>What does “intent to return” mean?</h3>
							<p>
								Many country consulates will deny your visa application if you show an intent to engage in other activities not directly related to your academics or if you plan to remain in the country without reason after your academic program is over. To avoid this, you should intend to return to your home country after the completion of your programme.
							</p>
					<h2><a name="mission">College Life</a></h2>
						<h3>Is culture shock real?</h3>
							<p>
								Culture shock is all too real. Studying abroad is going to involve you making all sorts of changes. You may welcome some of this changes while others may be discomforting. You need to be able to recognize the symptoms of culture shock as unease, anger, withdrawal etc. and recognize its impacts. To deal with culture shock it is often very helpful to make friends and develop relationships and maintain contact with family and friends back at home.
							</p>
						<h3>What’s college life like?</h3>
							<p>
								The answer to this question varies of course from institution to institution. However, college is generally tasking, exciting and rewarding depending on the effort you put into it. On many occasions you will get little to no sleep but on the other hand you will meet interesting and diverse people, forge strong connections and friendships and make memories that will always be with you even long after graduation.
							</p>
						<h3>How should I prepare for college life?</h3>
							<p>
								The biggest preparation you will need is mental. The transition from high school to college is hard for many because they have not matured to be self-motivated and do not take initiative academically or otherwise. A big part of navigating college is finding the right balance between school and other responsibilities and emotional maturity is a crucial trait you need to have to find this balance. You should also prepare yourself for the fact you will be in a foreign country, most likely away from the family and friends that have surrounded you most likely since birth. You will need to be open to new experiences and finding a new community.
							</p>
						<h3>What should I pack?</h3>
							<p>
								Airlines often have a limit on how much luggage one can check in on a plane. It is important to bear this in mind when packing for college. Also consider how much your luggage will affect your mobility as you pack. You should pack some casual clothing, comfortable shoes, and at least one business formal outfit and a winter jacket if travelling to a cold region. Consider including an item to remind you of home and pictures of family.
